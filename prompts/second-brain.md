description: Review and organize your second brain — check inbox, update priorities, capture recent learnings
---

Review my second brain knowledge base. Do the following:

1. Read today's daily note using `second_brain_daily` with action "read"
2. Search for any recent captures using `second_brain_search` with query "captured today"
3. Give me a brief status report:
   - Today's priorities and their status
   - Any items in the inbox that need processing
   - Key things logged today
   - Suggestions for what to capture or organize

Keep it concise and actionable.
